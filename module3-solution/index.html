            Aside from a name that's a hoot to utter, Chicken Riggies (aka
            Utica, New York’s pasta pride and joy) has a lot more going for it,
            namely that it's a spicy and a bit-sweet pleasure to eat. It’s so
            good, it might just become a new go-to weeknight dinner for all you
            non-Uticans out there.

            You know skirt steak as the star of beef fajitas. But this
            scrumptious cut is no one-hit wonder. Skirt steak is the
            budget-friendly beef that brings big flavor, particularly when it's
            marinated and grilled. Try these diverse preparations, and you'll
            wonder why you ever spent heaps more on the expensive steaks. And
            don't forget to cut skirt steak against the grain. The meat will be
            so much more tender.

            Center 1 nori sheet on a bamboo sushi mat. Use wet hands to spread a
            thin layer of rice on top. Arrange 1/4 of the crabmeat, avocado,
            cucumber, and pickled ginger over rice in a line down the center.
            Lift one end of the mat and roll it tightly over filling to make a
            complete roll. Repeat with remaining ingredients.
